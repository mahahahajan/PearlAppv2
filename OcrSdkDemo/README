# Pearl-App

<b>The Official Notetaking App Pearl</b>
<p>This is the main git repository for the Pearl App. Below is the development plan: </p>
<p><b>Backend</b></p>
<ol> 
<li>Set up OCR using abbyy's 90 day trial. Turn the image into text. [Quick start guide: http://ocrsdk.com/documentation/quick-start/iphone-ocr-sdk/]</li>
<li>Take that text and run it through three API's. See below. </li>
  <li>Display that information in categories on the info page</li>
  <li> Use Parse perhaps. </li>
  <li>Done! That's the backend!</li>
</ol>
<p>Three API's are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A summarization API (tons on the internet, find any)</li>
  <li>A main concepts API (<a href="http://idolondemand.com">HP</a>)</li>
  <li>Facts from dragonfly (Pull from the search API for the top three main ideas from HP, <a href="http://dragonflysearch.com/api/search.php?q=Search+Query">click here)</a></li>
  </ul>
<p><b>Frontend</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Camera page. The page you take the photo, also the default page when you open the app. Should have a bar at the bottom that can take you to settings and past images. </li>
<li>Past images page. This page has a list of all past images. Each item has a date a mini shot of the image. When you click on it you go to the info page. When you select them you can save them to a default email or GDrive accuont you have on file. </li>
<li>Info page. This page contains the guts of the app: the information. This page shows up after an image or when you click on a past image. It should a nice list of a short summary of the iamge, a few key facts, further facts from Dragonfly, and then sponsered content such as videos, tutors, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember this is just a plan and it is always in development and this document doesn't represent the final solution. If you find a better way to execute this, awesome! Push that to the repository. </p>
